# Programming adventures
A repository in which I solve competitive programming problems.
Initially I do not think to solve security challenges, but who knows.

I am not uploading the problems statements. You may want to check them out in the respective web sites.

Here I let you the **structure** of problems and their **competitions/sites**. This **list** mainly shows the problems I have **solved**, not all the problems.

:heavy_check_mark: : Problem Solved

:x: : Problem attempted, but failed
